**Step 1**:

3. Now you need to put some passwords to ssh into your Server root
4. In `master.php` replace `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your ssh pass for your server and the `YOUR_IP_ADDRESS` with your ip address

You can't use it for commercial use ! (or you an contact me at rabihmteyrek@hotmail.com)
Please don't steel it and use it wisely.
Im not responsible if your password got stolen! It's not usually safe to put your password in a file without protection!

USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!
